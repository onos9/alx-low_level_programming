# 0x04. C - More Functions, More Nested Loops

This project contains C programs that demonstrate the use of functions and nested loops.

Files
The following files are included in this project:

File                 | Description
-------------------- | -------------------
0-isupper.c          | A function that checks for uppercase character
1-isdigit.c          | A function that checks for a digit (0 through 9)
2-mul.c              | A function that multiplies two integers
3-print_numbers.c    | A function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line
4-print_most_numbers.c | A function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line. Do not print 2 and 4
5-more_numbers.c     | A function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line
6-print_line.c       | A function that draws a straight line in the terminal
7-print_diagonal.c   | A function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal
8-print_square.c     | A function that prints a square, followed by a new line
9-fizz_buzz.c        | A program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz
10-print_triangle.c  | A function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line
101-print_number.c   | A function that prints an integer using _putchar function
100-prime_factor.c   | A program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143
holberton.h          | Header file that contains function prototypes

## Project Requirements

* Editors: vi, vim, emacs
* Compilation: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc with the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* Files should end with a new line
* A README.md file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
* Code should use the Betty style, checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* No use of global variables
* No more than 5 functions per file
* No use of standard library functions like printf, puts, etc.
* Use of _putchar is allowed
* Do not push _putchar.c file, it won't be taken into account
* Prototypes of all functions and the _putchar function should be included in the header file main.h
* Header file main.h should be pushed
